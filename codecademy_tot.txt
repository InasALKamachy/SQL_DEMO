Write the following queries:
1.
Getting started, take a look at the startups table:

SELECT *
FROM startups;
How many columns are there?


Hint
You can expand the right panel (or scroll right) to take a look at all the columns.

The startups table has ten columns:

name
location
category
employees
raised
valuation
founded
stage
ceo
info
Do you recognize any of these companies?

2.
Calculate the total number of companies in the table.


Hint
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM startups;
There are 70 companies in the table.

3.
We want to know the total value of all companies in this table.

Calculate this by getting the SUM() of the valuation column.


Hint
SELECT SUM(valuation)
FROM startups;
The sum is $974,455,790,000!

4.
What is the highest amount raised by a startup?

Return the maximum amount of money raised.


Hint
SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups;
5.
Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money raised, during ‘Seed’ stage.


Hint
SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups
WHERE stage = 'Seed';
6.
In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?


Hint
SELECT MIN(founded)
FROM startups;
Let's find out the valuations among different sectors:
7.
Return the average valuation.


Hint
SELECT AVG(valuation)
FROM startups;
8.
Return the average valuation, in each category.


Hint
SELECT category, AVG(valuation)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
9.
Return the average valuation, in each category.

Round the averages to two decimal places.


Hint
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
10.
Return the average valuation, in each category.

Round the averages to two decimal places.

Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowest.


Hint
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
Health Care startups seem to have higher valuations than other categories.

What are the most competitive markets?
11.
First, return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it.


Hint
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
12.
Next, filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them.

What are the most competitive markets?


Hint
Because you are filtering on a condition that has an aggregate function, you need to use HAVING instead of WHERE:

SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
If you want to go a step further, sort the result using ORDER BY:

SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
The most competitive markets are:

Social
Mobile
Education
Let's see if there's a difference in startups sizes among different locations:
13.
What is the average size of a startup in each location?


Hint
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location;
14.
What is the average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500?


Hint
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500;
